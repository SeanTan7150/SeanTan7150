### Feel free to explore! ğŸ‘€
> Below are some projects I involved

1. [Web3 Employment Package Management System](https://github.com/SeanTan7150/web3-employment-package-management-system)
- This project is my Final Year Project. It is a web-based platform that implements Sepolia smart contract, allowing employer and employee to manage their employment package.
- e.g.: Offer letter, promotion letter, resignation letter.
- By securing it with smart contract, it allow both employer and employee to sign it with digital signature for a better transparency while supporting immutability. 

2. [Java Car Rental System](https://github.com/SeanTan7150/java-car-rental-system)
- This project was built throughout my journey on learning Object-Oriented Programming using pure Java.
- Of course, this was built with my best friend [@tanweikang](https://github.com/tanweikang02)
